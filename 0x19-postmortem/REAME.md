Postmortem for my E-commerce Site

Issue Summary:
On May 12th, 2023, our company's e-commerce platform took a three-hour nap. We apologize to our customers for this unannounced siesta and any loss of sales or frustration caused.

Timeline:
- 10:00 AM: Our platform started feeling a little sluggish, like a sloth with a hangover.

- 11:00 AM: Our platform decided to take a nap and went offline.
- 11: 15 AM: We sent out the first public communication to announce the incident on our public status page and Twitter account, hoping to wake our platform up from its slumber.
- 11:30 AM: We shook our platform awake and called in extra support to address the problem.
- 1:00 PM: We gave our platform some caffeine and identified the root cause of the issue, implementing a fix that restored its functionality.

Root Cause:
Our platform's load balancer was the culprit behind its naptime. One of our network engineers had recently made a change to the configuration to optimize the load balancing, which unfortunately introduced a bug that went undetected during testing. This bug caused the load balancer to become overloaded and stop responding, resulting in the website's unexpected downtime.

Corrective and Preventive Measures:
To prevent future nap times, we will take the following corrective and preventive measures:
1. Review and revise our change management process, to ensure that our platform doesn't hit the snooze button on changes that are not well tested.
2. Increase monitoring and alerting, to catch any sleepy bugs that may try to sneak into our platform.
3. Enhance communication, to keep our customers in the loop and prevent them from hitting the panic button.
4. Conduct a post-incident review, to identify any underlying issues that may have contributed to the naptime and prevent them from recurring.

In conclusion, we are sorry that our platform took an unannounced nap on May 12th, and we appreciate our customers' patience and understanding. We take this issue seriously and will do everything in our power to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
